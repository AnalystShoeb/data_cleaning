# Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes and cleans a dataset of 74,111 Airbnb listings across various cities. The main objectives are to uncover insights related to pricing trends, property types, host behaviors, and geographic dataâ€”key for hosts, investors, and analysts. The data cleaning process addresses missing values, transforms data types, and applies filtering to prepare the dataset for in-depth analysis.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, standardize data types, and normalize data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore variables such as property type, room type, amenities, and pricing.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visuals to reveal trends and relationships within the dataset.
- **Insights for Decision Making**: Identify patterns in pricing, popular amenities, host behaviors, and investment opportunities.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- **Listings Information**: Property type, room type, amenities, and accommodates.
- **Pricing Details**: Log-transformed price.
- **Host Information**: Host response rate, identity verification, and profile picture status.
- **Geographical Data**: Latitude, longitude, city, and neighborhood.
- **Reviews**: Number of reviews, review scores, and review dates.

## Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Handle Missing Values**: Fill or drop missing data based on relevance.
2. **Data Type Transformation**: Ensure data types, like datetime formats and numeric values, are accurate.
3. **Normalization and Scaling**: Scale certain columns for easier analysis and comparison.
4. **Outlier Removal**: Identify and manage outliers, particularly in pricing and key variables.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Add or modify columns to enhance analytical depth.

## Conclusion

The Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis project offers a solid framework for understanding the short-term rental market. By thoroughly cleaning and preparing the dataset, we derive reliable insights into market dynamics, host practices, and pricing strategies. This project highlights the importance of data preparation and provides patterns that support data-driven decisions for stakeholders in the Airbnb ecosystem.
